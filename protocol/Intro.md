## Intro
LevSwap provide users with a novel decentralized synthetic leveraged token exchange that allows users to synthesize and trade leveraged tokens of any asset.
  
The synthetic leveraged tokens we designed have the following advantages:
1) Decentralization, no censorship, no KYC
2) Allow users to synthesize and trade leveraged tokens of any asset
3) Automatically adjust leverage ratio (volatility around 3X)
